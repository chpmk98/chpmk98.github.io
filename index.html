        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        Alvin Tan is a first-year PhD student at UC Berkeley, working in a 
        cyber-physical systems lab called Lab11 and taking courses in control 
        theory and robotics. He is currently investigating microbial fuel cells 
        and machine learning on the edge, and he has research interests in energy 
        harvesting, artificial intelligence, and wireless sensor networks. He 
        plans to pursue a career in quantitative trading or as a university 
        professor upon graduation.<br><br>

        Alvin graduated summa cum laude with undergraduate honors from 
        Northwestern University in 2020 with a BS in computer engineering 
        and triple majors in economics and mathematics. At Northwestern, 
        he was the Alumni Chair for the engineering honor society Tau Beta Pi 
        and a member of the electrical and computer engineering honor society 
        Eta Kappa Nu. He also mentored students as a tutor with NU Tutors, as 
        a peer facilitator with Academic Support and Learning Advancement, and 
        as a peer mentor for the computer system software course. In addition 
        to coursework and mentorship, he conducted research in two labs (BISOL 
        and Ka Moamoa), taught Sunday school at Evanston Bible Fellowship, and 
        worked as a library aide at the Main Library circulation desk. For more 
        details, please refer to his

        Alvinâ€™s life goals are to tackle interesting challenges and develop 
        transformative technologies to revolutionize our everyday lives. 
        Additionally, he is passionate about mentorship and enabling others 
        around him to also pursue their ambitions and improve the world we 
        live in.
